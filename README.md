## Getting Started

The app is built in React Native and uses Expo for faster development workflow

## How it Works



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Preferred IDE e.g. Visual Studio

A working Android Emulator/Physical Device

Node Version 12 LTS or later

```

### Installing

Use the following steps to get up and running as fast as possible and get back to building cool content.

#### Expo Setup

Use the following command to setup expo in your machine

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

If you prefer yarn then use the command:
```
yarn global add expo-cli
```
#### Install Dependencies

First navigate to the project root folder. Next steo is to download all the dependencies used in the project by type this in the terminal window

```
yarn

```

#### Run the Project

To run the app simply type ```yarn start``` and it will launch a window in your browser. This starts the Metro server and is now accessible to whichever platform we would like to run the app on.

For Physical Android Device, download the Expo app from play store, open it and use the QR scanner functionality to launch the app.

For Emulator, the process is easier. Simply click the ```Run on Android Device/Emulator``` option from the browser window and Expo will automatically detected an already running emulator and run the app on it.
